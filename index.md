I like to create [videos](portfolio/#videos), [tutorials](portfolio/#documentation), and explain complex things in simple ways. It is like solving a puzzle. 

I tend to see the best in people, even when they can't see it in themselves. 

I believe in the work hard / play hard approach to work and life. There are times to focus and produce a polished product. But it must be balanced by jokes, laughing, and maintaining a playful nature and sense of humility about the whole process. Be serious about not taking life too seriously!

But seriously. I get a great sense of pride when accomplishing a large project with my team. At the end of the day, when the dust has settled, we can all look at each other and say, "Good job."

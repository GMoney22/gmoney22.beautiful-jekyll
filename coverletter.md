#### To My Future Manager,

My name is Garrett Griffith.  I am graduate of the University of Texas at Austin, and I am currently employed as a technical writer at the software company, cPanel.

I am a team player, who can get the job done on time, the first time. I am personable and easily get along with. I have extensive work experience, I am constantly developing skills in strong communication, user experience, product design, and how to think outside the box.

If you want a candidate who has analytic / problem solving skills coupled with a strong work ethic (can do attitude / hands-on / do the job right the first time), I can fill that role. I am looking for a remote position at a company I can call home, where I can grow and develop my professional skills.

I appreciate your time in reading this cover letter and I look forward to meeting with you in person.

Sincerely,

Garrett Griffith
